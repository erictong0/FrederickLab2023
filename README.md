# FrederickLab2023
This is the code created by Eric Tong during his work with the Frederick Lab through the STARS program in the summer of 2023. 

The code ranges from determining freezing time of particles, linear regressions to determine the best regions of ramachandran space, and subtracting experimental NMR data from predicted.
